# UMich EECS Computer Programming for Scientists and Engineers
Projects of 2019 Fall Semester
### Project 1
Mini-Project
To accrue interest for an investment account
### Project 2
Implement object-oriented principles.
- ColorClass: the RGB value
- RowColumnClass: the pixel position

### Project 4
Used doubly linked list to implement the following data structures, without using STL
- sorted list
- FIFO Queue
- LIFO Stack
### Project 5
Server simulation at a fast food restaurant. 
Used templates so that doubly linked list functions are able to have class type values in each node.
Used pseudo-random numbers to generate the scheduled times of the events that will happen.
